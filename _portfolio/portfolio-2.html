title: "Data-driven modelling of multiphase flows"
excerpt: "In this project, we seek to find closures for stochastic models of particle motion in turbulent flows (large eddy simulations) 
using data-driven modelling such as neural networks (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0121344'>Physics of Fluids paper</a>). 
I am interested in extending this approach to different physical phenomena, 
with the goal of incorporating in real applications such as modelling drug inhalation.

See <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0121344">our previous paper</a> in Physics of Fluids, where we used neural networks to learn unknown terms in a stochastic model for turbulent dispersion of inertial particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This requires filtered DNS data from highly resolved simulations and advanced data-driven modelling techniques.
