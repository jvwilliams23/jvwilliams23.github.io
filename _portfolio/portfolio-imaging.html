title: "Image analysis/quantitative imaging"
excerpt: "I am interested in developing image analysis pipelines to extract metrics that describe the morphology of complex structures such as lung airways (figure below). 
We have developed a Python package for statistical shape and appearance modelling (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04416'>pyssam</a>), which can be used to analyse correlation of complex shapes
over a population.
