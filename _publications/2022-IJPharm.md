Highlights:

- Regional and local drug deposition was modelled in three patients during normal, sinusoidal inhalation and an exacerbation.

- Local drug deposition changes with airway shape and inhalation profile, even when regional deposition is similar.

- Image-based models were combined with highly-resolved particle tracking including particle contact and cohesion.

- Fluid model validated by comparing gas velocity field with in vitro experiments.
