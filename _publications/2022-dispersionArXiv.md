Highlights:

- Used highly-resolved simulation data with neural networks to develop a stochastic model for particle dispersion

- The model is consistent with the kinetic energy decay in large-eddy simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence

- The model provides improved predictions of particle velocity distributions and fluctuating kinetic energy, compared to with no model

- Dataset is available on Kaggle [(dataset link)](http://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/3998403)

- Code for training and running simulations will be uploaded to GitHub after peer-review [(repository link)](https://github.com/jvwilliams23/turbulent-dispersion-neuralSDE)
