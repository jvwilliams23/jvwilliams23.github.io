## Data-driven modelling of multiphase flows
In this project, we seek to find closures for stochastic models of particle motion in turbulent flows (large eddy simulations) 
using data-driven modelling such as neural networks (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0121344'>Physics of Fluids paper</a>). 
I am interested in extending this approach to different physical phenomena, 
with the goal of incorporating in real applications such as modelling drug inhalation.

## Image analysis/quantitative imaging
I am interested in developing image analysis pipelines to extract metrics that describe the morphology of complex structures such as lung airways (figure below). 
We have developed a Python package for statistical shape and appearance modelling (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04416'>pyssam</a>), which can be used to analyse correlation of complex shapes
over a population.
