## Modelling and simulation

My main experience lies in modelling and simulation of turbulent single- and multiphase flows at a continuum scale. I am interested in this at a fundamental level (e.g. LES and DNS of canonical flows such as turbulent channel flow) and studying applications of these flows (such as [aerosol drug transport in patient airways](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.121321)).

### Applications of CFD simulations
I like to study fluid dynamics in 'real-world' applications, to see how flow structures influence relevant quantities of interest such as drug deposition in lung airways ([Int. J. Pharm. paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.121321)), or efficiency of industrial processes.

### Data-driven modelling of multiphase flows
In this project, we seek to find closures for stochastic models of particle motion in turbulent flows (large eddy simulations) 
using data-driven modelling such as neural networks (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0121344'>Physics of Fluids paper</a>). 
I am interested in extending this approach to different physical phenomena, 
with the goal of incorporating in real applications such as modelling drug inhalation.

## Image analysis/quantitative imaging
I am interested in developing image analysis pipelines to extract metrics that describe the morphology of complex structures such as lung airways (figure below). Specifically, I am interested in how the structure of these organs correlates to function. For example, how does airway shape influence the deposition of aerosols in CFD simulations.

Previously, we have developed a Python package for statistical shape and appearance modelling (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04416'>pyssam</a>), which can be used to analyse correlation of complex shapes
over a population.
