Hi, my name is Josh Williams! I am a third year PhD candidate at Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh, UK). I am funded by the [Carnegie-Trust for the Universities of Scotland](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/alumni/josh-williams-2/). My research is focussed towards improving dispersion and deposition of inhaled therapeutics in respiratory patients' lungs. 

My main research interests include:

* Mathematical modelling
    * Computational fluid dynamics with OpenFOAM (multiphase flows and biofluids)
    * Granular flows (LIGGGHTS/CFDEMcoupling)
* Combining machine learning with physical modelling
    * Neural differential equations ([**paper link**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08156))
* Image-processing
    * Convolutional neural networks
    * Statistical shape and appearance models
