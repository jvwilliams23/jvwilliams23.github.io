Hi, my name is Josh Williams! I am a computational scientist at STFC, Hartree Centre. I obtained a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh, UK), funded by the [Carnegie-Trust for the Universities of Scotland](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/alumni/josh-williams-2/). My research is focussed towards improving dispersion and deposition of inhaled therapeutics in respiratory patients' lungs. 

My main [research interests](/research) include:

* Mathematical modelling
    * Computational fluid dynamics with OpenFOAM (multiphase flows and biofluids)
    * Granular flows (LIGGGHTS/CFDEMcoupling)
* Combining machine learning with physical modelling
    * Neural differential equations ([**paper link**](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0121344))
* Image-processing
    * Convolutional neural networks
    * Statistical shape and appearance models
